# Ebraz Emotional Finnace Tracker

**Ebraz** is a mindful personal finance tool that helps with tracking how users feel about their spendings.

Unlike traditional budgeting apps, Ebraz doesn't just ask *where* the money went — it asks *why*, and *how it made users feel*.

## 🧠 Why Use Ebraz?

Self-awareness leads to smarter decisions. By reflecting on the emotions behind your transactions, users can:

- Break emotional spending patterns
